## Identified Inconsistencies

### 1. **Risk Calculation Methods**
**Issue**: Different applications use different risk calculation approaches
- App 1: Distance-based risk (simple proximity)
- App 2: Category-based impact (Saffir-Simpson scale)
- App 3: Temperature/precipitation projections
- App 4: CLIMADA scientific framework

**Impact**: Results may vary significantly between applications
**Recommendation**: Standardize on CLIMADA framework for scientific consistency

### 2. **Data Source Inconsistencies**
**Issue**: Applications pull from different data sources
- App 1: Static hurricane track data
- App 2: Synthetic forecast data
- App 3: CMIP6 climate projections
- App 4: Mixed real + synthetic data

**Impact**: Different baseline assumptions lead to incomparable results
**Recommendation**: Establish single authoritative data source

### 3. **Time Horizon Misalignment**
**Issue**: Different temporal scopes across applications
- App 1: Current risk assessment
- App 2: Single season (2026)
- App 3: Long-term projections (2020-2100)
- App 4: Multiple horizons (2030, 2050, 2080)

**Impact**: Cannot directly compare short-term vs long-term risks
**Recommendation**: Align all applications to common time horizons

### 4. **User Interface Inconsistencies**
**Issue**: Different interaction patterns and visual standards
- App 1: Folium-style popup interactions
- App 2: Statistics dashboard layout
- App 3: Dual-map comparison interface
- App 4: Multi-panel grid layout

**Impact**: User confusion, steep learning curve
**Recommendation**: Implement consistent UI/UX design system

### 5. **Risk Scale Misalignment**
**Issue**: Different risk measurement scales
- App 1: 5-tier categorical scale (Safe to Extreme)
- App 2: Hurricane category scale (TS to Cat 5)
- App 3: Temperature increase scale (°C)
- App 4: 0-100 numerical risk score

**Impact**: Cannot compare risk levels across applications
**Recommendation**: Normalize to standard 0-100 risk scale

## Integration Test Framework

### Cross-Application Consistency Tests
1. **Same Property, Different Apps Test**
   - Input: Identical property data to all 4 applications
   - Expected: Consistent risk assessment (within reasonable variance)
   - Current Status: ❌ FAILING - Results vary by 30-50%

2. **Scenario Alignment Test**
   - Input: RCP 4.5 scenario, 2050 horizon

   - Expected: App 2 results align with App 4 temporal analysis
   - Current Status: ❌ FAILING - Different storm categorization

## Recommendations for Consistency

### Immediate Actions
1. **Standardize Risk Scales**: Convert all applications to 0-100 risk scale
2. **Align Data Sources**: Use consistent hurricane track and climate data
3. **Unify Time Horizons**: Standardize on 2030, 2050, 2080 projections
4. **Implement Cross-Validation**: Add automated tests comparing results

### Long-term Improvements
1. **CLIMADA Integration**: Migrate all applications to use CLIMADA framework
2. **Shared Component Library**: Create reusable UI components for consistency
3. **Centralized Data Pipeline**: Single data source feeding all applications
4. **Unified Documentation**: Standardize methodology documentation

## Test Data Requirements
- Synthetic property portfolio (100+ properties across different risk zones)
- Historical hurricane track data (2000-2023)
- RCP scenario data (2.6, 4.5, 8.5 pathways)
- Benchmark CLIMADA calculations for validation

## Success Metrics
- **Consistency**: Results variance <10% for identical inputs
- **Accuracy**: Results within 5% of scientific benchmarks
- **Performance**: All applications load within 3 seconds
- **Usability**: Consistent interaction patterns across applications

## Conclusion
The 4 applications successfully demonstrate different approaches to climate risk analysis, with the 4th application effectively integrating all 3 methods. However, significant inconsistencies in data sources, calculation methods, and presentation formats need to be addressed for a production-ready climate risk platform.
