# Vercel Deployment Status

## Latest Deployment (2025-08-22)

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated `vercel.json`** - Configured for static site hosting with proper rewrites and headers
2. **Updated `package.json`** - Fixed build script for static site
3. **Added Framework Engines**:
   - `climate-os-statistical-engine.js` - Statistical analysis using NOAA data
   - `cbottle-property-engine.js` - Property-level risk assessment
   - `improved-hurricane-generator.js` - Already exists, used by CLIMADA as fallback

### Framework Status:
- **CLIMADA**: ✅ Using improved hurricane generator (Python backend optional)
- **Climate-OS**: ✅ Using statistical analysis engine
- **C-bottle**: ✅ Using property risk assessment engine

### Test Pages:
- `/deployment-test-vercel.html` - Deployment verification page
- `/test-all-frameworks.html` - Shows all three frameworks side-by-side
- `/test-climada-with-generator.html` - Tests CLIMADA with fallback generator

### Main Pages:
- `/index.html` - Main landing page with framework selection
- `/climada-hurricane-analysis.html` - CLIMADA main interface
- `/climate-os-statistical.html` - Climate-OS main interface  
- `/cbottle-risk-assessment.html` - C-bottle main interface

### Expected Behavior:
1. All HTML files should be directly accessible
2. JavaScript engines load client-side
3. Mapbox GL JS renders maps properly
4. Each framework uses its proprietary methodology
5. No build process required (static site)

### Vercel URL:
The site should be available at your Vercel deployment URL (check Vercel dashboard).

### Troubleshooting:
If you see 404 errors:
1. Check that files are committed and pushed
2. Verify Vercel is connected to the correct GitHub repo
3. Check Vercel build logs for any errors
4. Ensure `vercel.json` is properly configured

The deployment should be automatic after pushing to the main branch.
